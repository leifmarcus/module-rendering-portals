# Testing Portal rendering for Modules

This example shows how to render different modules in one page by using react portals. This mechanism can also be used to render modules of a page inside the editor.

The app still needs a main app element, but will render all elements based on the data received from the dataset with react portals.

```bash
# install dependencies:
npm install

# start project:
npm start

# open local project:
open http://localhost:8080
```
